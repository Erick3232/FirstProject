# FirstProject
Making a project in Java, using SpingBoot, JPA, Apache Maven, Hibernate, Postman and H2 as DataBase


In this project, we have multiple ways to use it, but for now just inserting data and classifying them in the API. 
But in the future I will add more things for the user.

I made a diagram to better guide the operation of the application
